### 9/29/25: Testing react js
* What are components in React js
    * Piece of the user interface that plays its own role on your website. Has a unique appearance and function.
    * Can be as small as a button or as big as your page.
    * Components must start with a capital letter
* Components help you make "parts" that you can use for a bigger and more complex UI
    * This code is meant to be reusable
        * Can be reused on angular or vue for instance.
* How do you set up React?
    * To test react, use the code below in the header of your HTML.
    * You must also set the type of your script to babel
        * Like so, `<script type="text/babel">`
```html
<script src="https://unpkg.com/react@18/umd/react.development.js"></script>
<script src="https://unpkg.com/react-dom@18/umd/react-dom.development.js"></script>
<script src="https://unpkg.com/@babel/standalone/babel.min.js"></script>
```

* In order to use components, you must have a root component.
    * Once you have a root component, you can put other components inside it.
For example, the use of `<Home />` within my root component "App"
```js
   function App() {
        return (
            <div>
              <h1>Welcome to my test app</h1>
              <Home />
            </div>
        );
      }
```

* Use the function line to name your component
* Add return so the component appears on your `http-server`.

* Components must also include a react dom render.
    * Use the name of your root component so all the components including it and within it will appear on when you're viewing your HTML page.
```js
ReactDOM.render(<App />, document.querySelector("#app"));
```

* If you use separate .js files for your components, they must be linked onto your html page using `src="filename.js"` like so,
```html
<script type="text/babel" src="App.js"></script>
<script type="text/babel" src="Home.js"></script>
```

If your components are properly "rendered" then your html page should show your components, like this for example:

<img width="377" height="149" alt="2025-10-02 18_26_06-Hello World and 4 more pages - Personal - Microsoftâ€‹ Edge" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0b638839-3b76-47e5-8830-f2f80f45693e" />
